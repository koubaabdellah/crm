# OroActivityContactBundle

OroActivityContactBundle enables tracking of attempts to contact customers in OroCRM applications.

The bundle allows developers to register activity as contact activity. These logged activities are used during the contact attempts calculation and allow admin users to see contact attempts statistics for entities where contact activities are enabled.

Out-of-the-box, the bundle registers calls and emails as contact activities.

Please see [online documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/bundles/crm/ActivityContactBundle/) for more information.
